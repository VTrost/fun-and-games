        <h1>The Witch Cottage</h1>
        <p>If rumors could be believed, a(n) <i><b>TEST</b></i> witch lived in the old cottage outside of the village. It is said that on moonless nights she would <i><b>TEST</b></i> strange spells. Often, <i><b>TEST</b></i> smoke was seen rising from the chimney, reaching to the sky like a <i><b>TEST</b></i>. Laughter and moans could be heard through open windows by anyone who dared to get close to the cottage.</p>

        <p> Not that many people from the village dared to come within <i><b>TEST</b></i> feet of the garden fence. Once, many years ago, a <i><b>TEST</b></i> tried to steal some <i><b>TEST</b></i> from the garden but they fled in fear after hearing a <i><b>TEST</b></i> that made their blood run cold. The cause of the sound is still a mystery to the people of the village.</p>

        <p>Despite the rumors, no one really minds the <i><b>TEST</b></i> witch and her cottage. The witch causes no problems for the village and the village causes no problems for the witch. The most unusual thing about the situation was that no one in the village realized that there wasn’t one witch but two.</p>

        <p>The villagers came by so seldomly and stayed so briefly that they had never seen the witch and her wife in the same place at the same time. Which was quite the feat itself considering how seldomly the two lovebirds were apart from each other.</p>
