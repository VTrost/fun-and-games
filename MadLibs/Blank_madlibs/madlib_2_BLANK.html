        <h1>The Vampire’s Roommate</h1>
        <p>Visitors were often surprised to find that a vampire lived in the center of town. To locals, however, the vampire was as commonplace as the streets they walked on. After all, the vampire had lived there since before the town even existed.</p>

        <p>The vampire was <i><b>ADJECTIVE_1</b></i> and got along well with everyone in the town. He spent most of his time at home <i><b>VERB_1</b></i> but once a week he would take a stroll around town and once a month would leave the town to visit a friend. At least that is what he said he was doing. Theories ranged from believing him to claiming that he was <i><b>VERB_2</b></i> in the <i><b>PLACE_1</b></i> in the next town over.</p>
            
        <p>For <i><b>NUMBER_1</b></i> generations the vampire had always lived alone. Considering how <i><b>ADJECTIVE_2</b></i> he was, everyone assumed that was the way he liked it and the way it would always be. Hence everyone’s surprise when the morning after the vampire’s monthly trip they saw a man in the vampire’s house. They kept expecting him to leave but <i><b>NUMBER_2</b></i> days passed and still he remained.</p>
            
        <p>He became the talk of the town. Everyone theorized about who he was and what he was doing in the vampire’s house. Some thought he was a(n) <i><b>PROFESSION_1</b></i> and others were sure he must be a(n) <i><b>PROFESSION_2</b></i>.</p>
            
        <p>The first time that the vampire and the man walked together in the town, they were instantly swarmed by people wanting to know if their guess was the correct one. The vampire listened to their ideas with amusement while the man next to him fidgeted nervously.</p>
            
        <p>“You’re all wrong,” the vampire laughed at last, “He isn’t a(n) <i><b>PROFESSION_1</b></i> or a(n) <i><b>PROFESSION_2</b></i> or a relative. He’s my boyfriend.”</p>
