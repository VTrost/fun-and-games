        <h1>Forest of Ghosts</h1>
        <p>Deep in the mountains sat the Forest of Ghosts. It was a(n) <i><b>ADJECTIVE_1</b></i> place but not a dangerous one. The ghosts were not malevolent or even particularly active at all. They simply lived in the trees. Each tree housed a single ghost and the form of the tree reflected the form of the ghost inside.</p>

        <p>The oldest tree was a(n) <i><b>ADJECTIVE_2</b></i> <i><b>TREE_1</b></i> tree that was home to the ghost of a <i><b>OCCUPATION_1</b></i>. It had <i><b>COLOR_1</b></i> flowers on it all year long because in life the ghost loved to eat <i><b>COLOR_1</b></i> candies.</p>

        <p>The smallest tree was a miniature <i><b>TREE_2</b></i> tree. Oddly enough, its ghost was anything but small in life. Picture the biggest guy at the gym and this guy was bigger. But he had a huge soft spot for baby animals, especially <i><b>ANIMAL_1</b></i>, and baby anything for that matter, so his ghost tree was equally small and adorable.</p>

        <p>The biggest tree was a massive chestnut tree. In life, its ghost had the tendency to <i><b>VERB_1</b></i> with <i><b>NOUN_1</b></i>, an action that tended to get them in trouble. They had a bold personality that was hard to miss, hence why their tree was so massive.</p> 

        <p> The most unusual tree was a curvy <i><b>TREE_3</b></i> tree. It was an easy tree to find because it was the only one that didn’t stand straight. It would be strange if it did because the ghost inside it was flamboyantly  gay, so of course even its tree couldn’t grow straight.</p>
