        <h1>The Odd Trio</h1>
        <p>They were an odd trio. And not just because there were three of them. They would have been odd if there were two or four of them also. The oddness came from the fact that they were all extremely different.</p>

        <p> First off was the vampire. She was <i><b>ADJECTIVE_1</b></i> and always woke up at exactly <i><b>TIME_1</b></i>. She was passionate about <i><b>NOUN_1</b></i> and had a tendency to challenge people who annoy her to a game of <i><b>GAME_OR_SPORT_1</b></i> to teach them a lesson.</p>

        <p>Next was the werewolf. He was <i><b>ADJECTIVE_2</b></i> and worked as a(n) <i><b>OCCUPATION_1</b></i>. Under a full mood he would transform into a <i><b>COLOR_1</b></i> wolf but the rest of the time he acted more like a cat. He couldn’t resist knocking <i><b>NOUN_2</b></i> off the table or counters and if there was an empty box he would <i><b>VERB_1</b></i> in it. He looked scary due to his size but he was really just a loveable dork once you got to know him.</p>

        <p>Last was the ghost, though, due to his convincing human appearance, most people didn’t know he was a ghost. He was <i><b>ADJECTIVE_3</b></i> with long <i><b>COLOR_2</b></i> hair that would make anyone jealous. He was aloof and only cared about <i><b>NOUN_3</b></i> and his partners. Hurt or insult the vampire or werewolf and you were guaranteed to face the wraith’s wrath.</p>

        <p>The trio was an unusual mix but they were inseparable and shared the one-bedroom cottage with ease. They also all insisted on getting flowers for both of their partners every Valentines Day, White Day, and Christmas which kept the local florist very well-paid.</p>
