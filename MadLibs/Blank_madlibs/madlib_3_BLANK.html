        <h1>The Costume House</h1>
        <p>Halloween was fast approaching which meant that the <i><b>ADJECTIVE_1</b></i> house on the corner was suddenly the most popular house in the whole town of Brew’s Hollow. Every Halloween the county hosted a Halloween party for all the towns in the area and the main event was a costume contest. The prizes were always excellent and that year the runners up got <i><b>NOUN_1</b></i> and the winner got a <i><b>NOUN_2</b></i>. Everyone and their <i><b>ANIMAL_1</b></i> wanted to win. The theme for the contest was <i><b>THEME_1</b></i> and costumes could either be solo or group efforts.</p>

        <p>Though many people did choose to do the costumes themselves, almost every entry from Brew’s Hollow were team efforts with two particular men behind them all. The men weren’t out to win, they couldn’t care less about the contest, they simply helped out where they could because they enjoyed seeing the smiles on everyone’s faces.</p>

        <p>No costume request was too much for the pair to deliver. A <i><b>COLOR_1</b></i> <i><b>ANIMAL_2</b></i> wearing a <i><b>NOUN_3</b></i>? No problem. A <i><b>MYTHICAL_CREATURE_1</b></i> from <i><b>PLACE_1</b></i>? Easy. With one man at the sewing machine and his husband on hair and makeup, nothing was impossible.</p>

        <p>Some people had been hesitant when the odd couple from the city moved into the small, rural town. But it didn’t take long for people to see the advantages of having a pair of drag queens in the neighborhood.</p>
