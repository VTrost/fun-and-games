        <h1>The Ghost and the Pans</h1>
        <p>The house was haunted. There was no doubt about that. Overtime, however, it became unclear whether it was the living or the dead doing the haunting.</p>

        <p>The ghost spent most of its time in the <i><b>ROOM_1</b></i>, only occasionally venturing to other parts of the house. When the current owners of the house learned this, they turned that room into a sort of shrine for the ghost. They even convinced all their visitors that offerings must be made to the ghost anytime a new person enters the house for the first time. People had many guesses about what form the offering should take. Some suggested <i><b>NOUN_1</b></i>, others were sure it was <i><b>NOUN_2</b></i>. According to the homeowners, the offering could be one thing and one alone: pans.</p>

        <p>No one understood the odd offering requirement but no one questioned it either. And so, every new person brought a pan the first time they entered the house. Between the “offerings” and the pans that the homeowners would occasionally add, the <i><b>ROOM_1</b></i> quickly started to fill with pans. There were pans of all sorts, even one shaped like a(n) <i><b>ANIMAL_1</b></i>. There were miniature pans and giant pans and a pan that glowed <i><b>COLOR_1</b></i> in the dark.</p>

        <p>Before long the <i><b>ROOM_1</b></i> became unusable because the floor was completely covered in pans. Despite the pans being “offerings” to the ghost, it was clear that the ghost wasn’t a fan of them because there would be many times when during the night pans had been moved to the <i><b>ROOM_2</b></i> instead. The homeowners didn’t mind, sometimes they would even be nice and get rid of some of the pans instead of putting them back. But they never stopped the influx of new pans.</p>

        <p>Finally one morning the living room wall was covered in red writing: “You know what pansexual means so stop giving me pans!”</p>
